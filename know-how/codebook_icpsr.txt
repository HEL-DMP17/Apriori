In order to read some specific fields from this dataset, don't bother preprocessing the raw file
in terms of delimiter fields, instead get the values using the starting and ending index from the line

# EXAMPLE, student's birth date is between index 32 to 37
chars = str(line)
print("Birth date: " + chars[31:37])
