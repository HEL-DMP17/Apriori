# University of Helsinki - Data mining project 2017
Ege Can Özer/Agustin Zuñiga
Project main repository: https://github.com/HEL-DMP17/Apriori

## Brief
Our project is related with the student-level data, our goal is to find interesting frequent patterns that could be related with things like the students performance, social and educational frameworks, depending on the frequent patterns. i.e. the relation between scores and gender, family income or parents education level. In order to do that we will implement Apriori Algorithm as well as different approaches to handle the different kind of attributes of the sample. The Project could be extended to compare the time and space complexity between different algorithms using FPGrowth algorithm.
The data matrix has 9,679 rows and 17 columns, it does not contain missing values. A detailed description of the data set could be find in the following link: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/mediation/student.html
