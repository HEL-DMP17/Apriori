Summary
=======
The project deals with the student-level data (ICPSR 4275) to find
frequent itemsets and extract associaton rules. We are hoping to find
social, educational, and cognitive relations. For instance, the students' performance, 
gender, family income, parents' education level may correlate with each other.
In order to do that we are using Apriori algorithm to mine frequent itemsets. We also
have provided some visualization methods, which are feasible to analyze the results.

Dataset
=======
We are using student-level data to study the classic data mining algorithm (Apriori). Briefly,
the dataset approximately consists of 15000 records and 1600 features. However, we are focused
only on 16 features. List of selected features could be seen in ``preprocessor.py`` file. 

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: `ELS 2002 Dataset <http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/4275>`_.

Installing and running the program
==================================
You can install and run the program from scratch as follows
::
    git clone https://github.com/HEL-DMP17/Apriori.git
    cd Apriori
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python arules.py


Source code layout
==================

(All the files are in the directory ``src`` of our repository.)

* ``preprocessor.py`` - Provides several methods and mapper class to preprocess the dataset
* ``apriori.py`` - Frequent itemset generation and association rules extraction in this file
* ``ppml_exporter.py`` - PMML file format exporter used to visualize the result in R
* ``utils.py`` - Utility functions are here
